        <p>
            Dr. Garry Fuller received his Doctor of Chiropractic Degree from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1987 and opened his Brownsburg practice in November of 1988.  Since that time, he has been caring for families ranging in age from newborn to 104 years young.  He has many hours of post graduate education in Low Level Laser Therapy, TMJ Treatment, Extremity Adjusting (including knees, shoulders, ankles, elbows, and wrists), MRI Interpretation, Physical Therapy, as well as 120 hours of Chiropractic Spinal Trauma all of which give him the expertise to help you eliminate the pain and start living your life again. When asked what the one thing he'd like prospective patients to know about him would be, Dr. Fuller said, "It's important to me that every person knows I'll always treat my patients just as I would treat my own family and how I like to be treated myself. Being able to trust that a chiropractor has your best interests at heart is vital to the healing process."

He has been married to his wife, Dawn, for 23 years and they have 3 grown boys who make them very proud.  Dr. Fuller and Dawn work together to ensure Fuller Chiropractic Clinic is a welcoming and inviting environment for each and every patient.
