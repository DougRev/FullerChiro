    <h2 class="section_title-new-patients">What To Expect On Your First Visit</h2>
    <p>Your first visit will take approximately one hour in office as Dr. Fuller will perform a full history and examination including neurological testing to identify if chiropractic care is indicated in your case. At that point he will determine if x-rays are medically necessary for further diagnostic review. If so, Dr. Fuller is fully equipped to take those in-house and trained to read and review those x-rays to determine a  course of action for your condition. Dr. Fuller will recommend a  plan based on your subjective complaints as well as his examination and neurological tests and begin treatment to get you back to feeling yourself as soon as possible.
